# Python-Guess-The-Country-Game

This project is actively under development. There are MD Files in each sub folder describing the details of each folder for the time being. 

## Main Home Repo Structure

The project is organized into several components, each with a specific purpose. Here's an overview of the main directories:

**Module-Country-Shape-Generator/**: This folder contains the code and resources for generating country shape images used in the game. The images are saved in the format `ISOStandardCode-CountryName.jpg`. Note that this directory contains a partial project focused on the generation of country shapes and not the entire game logic.

Other parts are still pending.
